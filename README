## fac

This repo is the snap dev repo for the [fac](https://github.com/mkchoi212/fac) program.

### Status

ðŸš§ This is currently a "work in progress". Please see the `issues` for current tasks and blockers.

### Interfaces

This snap currently requires you to manually connect the interfaces.

```
snap connect fac:dot-fac-yml :personal-files
snap connect fac:dot-gitconfig :personal-files
```

### Build Notes

* This snap requires snapcraft v4, so you need to use multipass when building (not lxd). So `snapcraft --debug` will work, whereas `snapcraft --use-lxd --debug` will not.
* For some reason snapcraft v4 requires dependencies to be staged with the Go plugin, whereas v3 did not. Forum post open for clarification.
